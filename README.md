## Oh hey. 

This should become /if I manage to be motivated enough/ my personal portfolio. Yay. Though it will mainly be french, but I've never seen a readme in french, it would have been too much a responsability for me if I was to be the first one to do so.
Anyway, if you're still reading this, then you should know that I mainly used [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/about.html), although it should be quite obvious if you check it out. And if you're wondering why I've decided to publish my portfolio here, there are 2 reasons :
* I love everything that's kind of open source-ish, so eh, no private repo.
* I believe versioning is one of the greatest thing in this universe, and I need to have access to it anywhere and Github was the easiest and fastest solution.
